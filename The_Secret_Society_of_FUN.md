# The Secret Society of F.U.N.

On the evening of the opening night of the Secret Society of F.U.N., the child genius Sylcie is kidnapped. With smiley bots on the rampage, what is she going to do?

## Chapter 1

"Where am I? Who are you? Why are you here?"

You crash through the window, sending splinters of glass showering into the room. In the sudden blackness, you see flickering light in the corner.

The television is showing pictures of weird, smiley face robots. These robots are powered by laughs, spitting out laughing gas, filling the room with the radius of three meters, they are no joke. The smile opens and belches out another room full of gas. The eyes transform into telescopes, no, guns, guns like telescopes. They shoot wildly, destroying everything and anything. There are pictures of a man, the Prime minister and a lady, the queen you presume, being held at gunpoint by more of these grinning mechanisms.

You look away, only to come face to face with a mirror. Hovering in front of you is one of those smiley faces. You reel away, bumping into a light switch. Sylcie, the child genius who made you, spins around, able to see again and spots you hovering there.

"Monster!" she tells you, "Monster!" You spin around, looking for the monster. You look into the mirror and realise the smiley face robot you saw was you. You did not realise that all your brothers and sisters were programmed to kill. The word monster echoes around the room.

You open your mouth. Streams of toys flow from your lips. Out of your eyes come sweets. You are no monster. You weren't made to kill.

## Chapter 2                                                    

At the opening of the Secret Society earlier that evening Sylcie had been terrified. Terrified. It was not her first time in a public spotlight, but it sure was the scariest.

With the crowds hands pumping like mad, it was going to be hard to resist the urge to join them, watching in awe the opener of the Secret Society of F.U.N.!

Crowds applauded wildly as she stepped on to the stage, and she was refuelled with confidence. She smiled and waved at the onlooking crowds. TV companies had refused her orders to stay away and flashed cameras and microphones all around. Security guards lined the stage, each with a snarling dog pulling at their leads. Time to cut the ribbon, the Secret Society of F.U.N. was open! So much for the cameras, and secrecy!

Sylcie had introduced her idea of the smiley bots. They were meant to be for the purposes of good, to give sweets and toys to the lonely children in the world, not soldiers with the purpose of world domination.

## Chapter 3

In the tower where Sylcie is trapped, Smiley replays a message.

"Sylcie, it's Dr E. You must believe me. No 2 is a traitor. The security guards and the smiley bots won't stop me, because I've got my badge. But he will stop me. Because I've got my badge. Treacherous dog. Liar. Good for nothing crook. So I need your help. Come quickly! We can get past everyone but No 2, OK? Everyone but No 2. I'll meet you at the smiley bot factory. See you soon!"

"Dr E. is the man who sent me with this," you say. And it's true.

No 2 did not count on any messages getting through, he did not think we would try, or could escape.

"Smiley, if I climb on you, can we go out of the window and down to the ground?"

You nod, her wish is your command. Down on the ground you look around, seeing, and fully understanding, the destruction of the smiley bots. You hurry onwards, carelessly slamming into tree branches, whenever you do sending Sylcie tumbling off your back.

Every time you do this she deserves another toy and another sweet. By the end of the journey she has seven toys and seven sweets. You meet Dr E at the entrance of the factory.

"If anyone asks, you are my lab assistant and we are improving the smiley bots" he tells Sylcie.

Creeping past all the security and smiley bots is a hard job and you have to stop yourselves laughing out loud many a time at the silly excuses you come up with. You shoot one of the smiley bots in the eye with a sweet. It's a lemon sherbert and the smiley bot is still gazing at it when you leave. How strange!

Sneaking into the control room you notice there is no way to turn off the smiley bots. What were you going to do? Sylcie seems to read your thoughts.

"Uh-oh! It seems we will have to reprogram the smiley bots rather than destroying them. I hope I can manage that." she remarks.

"How?" Dr E asks. Even though a fully grown adult, not as clever as a child genius.

"By upgrading them to become like Smiley of course!"

She wires you up to the huge computer and sets about doing all she can to change them. She makes sweets and toys come out of them. She makes them be powered by happiness and to always be good. But most importantly she lets them learn. A new species is created out of a kidnap and that is good.

## Epilogue

No 2 did not go down the toilet, fortunately his plan did! He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. A community service he had to fulfil was putting together broken toys and making new sweets.

As for smiley bot No 1? He is Sylcie's personal smiley bot and proud to be it! Sylcie is going up in the world. Who knows? She may be our next female Prime minister. And Dr E? As long as the F.U.N. is still going strong, he'll be fine!
