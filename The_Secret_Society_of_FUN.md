# The Secret Society of F.U.N.

## Chapter 1

"I can't see. I'm not scared. I can't hear! I'm not frightened. I can't feel! I'm not terrified! Is this what it's like to be dead? But if you're still here I can't be dead not really can I! No, I can't, you could have told me that, or maybe you couldn't? What are you anyway? You strange creature?! Look! A light! There, in the corner!" The light in the corner is a television. You could have told her that, you are a robot after all you know, not some interested reader looking at this story. So, let's get on with it.

OK, the light in the corner (television for short) is showing pictures of weird, smiley face robots. Yeah, I mean, that's weird! But no, these robots are powered by laughs, spitting out laughing gas, filling the room with the radius of three meters, they are no joke. The smile opens and belches out another room full of gas. The eyes transform into telescopes, no, guns I mean, guns like telescopes. They shoot wildly, destroying everything and anything. There are pictures of a man, the Prime minister and a lady, the queen you presume, being held at gunpoint.

You look away, only to come face to face with a mirror. Hovering in front of you is one of those smiley faces. You reel away, bumping into a light switch. Child genius (we will call her C.G. or Sylcie if you must. Sil-sea not Shleese) spins around, able to see again and spots you hovering there.

"Monster!" she tells me "monster!" I spin around, looking for the monster. I see myself in the mirror. The words monster echoed around the room.

I opened my mouth. Streams of toys flow from my mouth. Out of my eyes come sweets. I wasn't made to kill.

## Chapter 2

In the tower where Sylcie is trapped, Smiley replays a message.

"Sylcie, it's Dr E. You must believe me. No 2 is a traitor. The security guards and the smiley bots won't stop me, because I've got my badge. But he will stop me. Because I've got my badge. Treacherous dog. Liar. Good for nothing crook. So I need your help. Come quickly! We can get past everyone but No 2, OK? Everyone but No 2. I'll meet you at the smiley bot factory. See you soon!"

"Dr E. is the man who sent me with this" you say. And it's true.

No 2 did not count on any messages getting through, he did not think we would try, or could escape.

"Smiley, if I climb on you, can we go out of the window and down to the ground?"

You nod, her wish is your command. Down on the ground you look around, seeing, and fully understanding, the destruction of the smiley bots. You hurry onwards, carelessly slamming into tree branches, whenever you do so sending Sylcie tumbling off your back.

Every time you do this she deserves another toy and another sweet. By the end of the journey she has seven toys and seven sweets. You meet Dr E at the entrance of the factory.

"If anyone asks, you are my lab assistant and we are improving the smiley bots" he tells Sylcie.

Creeping past all the security and smiley bots was a hard job and we had to stop ourselves laughing out loud many a time at the silly excuses we came up with. Once I shot one of the smiley bots in the eye with a sweet. It was a lemon sherbert and the smiley bot was still gazing at it when we left. How strange!

Sneaking into the control room I noticed there was no way to turn off the smiley bots. What were we going to do? Sylcie seemed to read my thoughts.

"Uh-oh! It seems we will have to reprogram the smiley bots rather than destroying them. I hope I can manage that." she remarked.

"How?" Dr E asked, even though a fully grown adult, not as clever as a child genius.

"By upgrading them to become like smiley of course!"

She wired me up to the huge computer and set about doing all she could to change them. She made sweets and toys come out of them. She made them to be powered by happiness and to always be good. But most importantly she let them learn. A new species was created out of a kidnap and that was good.

## Epilouge

No 2 did not go down the toilet fortunately his plan did! He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. A community service he had to fulfil was putting together broken toys and making new sweets.

As for smiley bot No 1? He is Sylcie's personal smiley bot and proud to be it! Sylcie is going up in the world. Who knows? She may be our next female Primeminister. And Dr E? As long as the F.U.N. is still going strong, he'll be fine!
