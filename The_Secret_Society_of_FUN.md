# The Secret Society of F.U.N.



## Chapter 1

Fun fact: Did you know F.U.N. stands for Fun Unit of Natural happiness?

"I can't see. I'm not scared. I can't hear! I'm not frightened. I can't feel! I'm not terrified! Is this what it's like to be dead? But if you're still here I can't be dead not really can I! No, I can't, you could have told me that, or maybe you couldn't? What are you anyway? You strange creature?! Look! A light! There, in the corner!" The light in the corner is a television. You could have told her that, you are a robot after all you know, not some interested reader looking at this story. So, let's get on with it.

OK, the light in the corner (television for short) is showing pictures of weird, smiley face robots. Yeah, I mean, that's weird! But no, these robots are powered by laughs, spitting out laughing gas, filling the room with the radius of three meters, they are no joke. The smile opens and belches out another room full of gas. The eyes transform into telescopes, no, guns I mean, guns like telescopes. They shoot wildly, destroying everything and anything. There are pictures of a man, the Prime minister and a lady, the queen you presume, being held at gunpoint.

You look away, only to come face to face with a mirror. Hovering in front of you is one of those smiley faces. You reel away, bumping into a light switch. Child genius (we will call her C.G. or Sylce if you must. Sil-sea not Shleese) spins around, able to see again and spots you hovering there.

"Monster!" she tells me "monster!" I spin around, looking for the monster. I see myself in the mirror. The words monster echoed around the room.

I opened my mouth. Streams of toys flow from my mouth. Out of my eyes come sweets. I wasn't made to kill.

## Chapter 2

Fun fact: The first ever smiley face bots were made by Sylce.

"When the smiley bots came nobody knows. Where they come from nobody knows. But me. You see, I'm a programmer. An engineer. I made the smiley bots. I know who they are. We'll go together, me, C.G. and the first smiley bot.

"Together we're going. I've got to stop them. They've got to stop. So I'm going, whether you like it or not. It's my duty. A man's got to do what a man's got to do. And I'm doing it.

"The security guards won't stop me, I've got my badge. The smiley bots won't stop me, I've got my badge. But he will stop me. Because I've got my badge. 'He' is the second in command, No 2, first mate. But funnily enough, I'd never heave him aboard my ship. Treacherous dog. Liar. Good for nothing crook. No 2 is not the sort of man you want to meet. Syrul (that's Si-rul) is his name. But money is his game.

"So, here are us. There's me, Dr. E you can call me, doctor in engineering. There's her, that's C.G., or Sylce, then there's you. Yes, you, the first ever smiley bot. Surely the best robot ever. We can get past everyone but No 2, OK? Everyone but No 2. (Not the type that gets flushed down the loo.)

"Send this message to Sylce, tell her I'll meet her at the smiley bot factory. See you soon!"

"Dr E. is the man who sent me with this" you say. And it's true.

No 2 did not count on any messages getting through, he did not think we would try, or could escape.

"Smiley, if I climb on you, can we go out of the window and down to the ground?"

You nod, her wish is your command. Down on the ground you look around, seeing, and fully understanding, the destination of the smiley bots. You hurry onwards, carelessly slamming into tree branches, whenever you do so sending Sylce tumbling off your back.

Every time you do this she deserves another toy and another sweet. By the end of the journey she has seven toys and seven sweets. You meet Dr E at the entrance of the factory.

"From now on you are my lab assistant and we are improving the smiley bots" he tells Sylce.

Creeping past all the Dr and smiley bots was a hard job and we had to stop ourselves laughing out loud many a time at the silly excuses we came up with. Once I shot one of the smiley bots in the eye with a sweet. It was a lemon sherbert and the smiley bot was still gazing at it when we left. How strange!

Sneaking into the control room I noticed there was no way to turn off the smiley bots. What were we going to do? Sylce seemed to read my thoughts.

"How are we going to turn them off without destroying the city?" she questioned.

"That is an excellent question my dear, I think we will have to reset them instead." Dr E told her.

"How?" Sylce asked, determined not to be put off.

"By upgrading them to become like smiley of course!"

He wired me up to the huge computer and set about doing all he could to change them. He made sweets and toys come out of them. He made them to be powered by happiness and to always be good. BUt most importantly he let them learn. A new species was created out of a kidnap and that was good.

## Epilouge

Fun fact: Did you know that Smiley bots have been transported to different countries but are still classed under being a 'secret'!

No 2 did not go down the toilet fortunately his plan did! He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. A community service he had to fulfil was putting together broken toys and making new sweets.

As for smiley bot No 1? He is Sylce's personal smiley bot and proud to be it! Sylce is going up in the world. Who knows? She may be our next female Primeminister. And Dr E? As long as the F.U.N. is still going strong, he'll be fine!
