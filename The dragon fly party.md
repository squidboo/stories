# The Dragonfly Party

## Chapter 1

Sneaking through the bushes, I glimpsed the daddy-long-legs looming over his prey. Daddy-long-legs were the sworn enemies of the dragonflies so it was my duty to stop him and rescue the poor innocent creature that was in his clutches.

The daddy-long-legs let out a sinister cackle, grinning wildly as he pounced on the tasty morsel. Half overcome by fright, I leapt into action. Giving the daddy-long-legs a hard kick, while hovering on my delicate purple wings, I sent him sprawling across the grass. Rage seemed to consume him, for he dove on me like a kingfisher dives on a fish. Just in time, a conker flew through the air, striking the daddy-long-legs on the head. I turned around to see the bug I'd rescued, another dragonfly, hovering confidently above me. Not wanting to fight any longer, we whisked through the air, searching for a good resting spot.

We landed nimbly on a tall weed, and began to talk.

"Thank you for rescuing me," said the dragonfly. "My name is Flyn, and I am a traveller."

"Well hello Flyn, my name is Lila, and I have come from the palace to find a present for the Queen Dragonfly," I replied. "I expect it to be hard, for finding the perfect present is surely not an easy task, and I'd be grateful for your help."

"It seems a worthy adventure, and I would like to help you find the perfect present for the Queen Dragonfly."

## Chapter 2

I awoke to find I an enormous spider web in front of me, stretching from the boughs of a birch tree. Stuck in his own web was a pompom with eight legs, black and furry. I recognised instantly the red stripes on its back, and realised it was a poisonous spider. He implored us: "Can you help me? I seem to be stuck in my own web!" We agreed to help him on one condition: he would not eat us.

When we had freed him from his silky straps, he questionned us why we were there and we told him our story. He listened with interest, then presented us with a spider silk dress.

"As well as my own friendship with the dragonfly queen, you freed me from my web, surely those reasons are worthy enough for a present to her."

## Chapter 3

After this first strange encounter, I do not know why I was surprised when we met a massive ladybird, the size of a conker, hiding under a leaf. She asked us where we were going and where we had come from. We told her the same story we'd told the spider. She told us that she was having some awful trouble with some aphids. Unfortunately, because she was so large she could not get round quick enough to eat them all. She asked us if we would help her take them prisoner in her store and become food for later need. We agreed.

Soon, we had all the aphids rounded up and ready to be jarred. Fortunately, we had our own food so did not have to suffer the torment of munching on the small green insects.

To show her gratitude, she gave us a rare and precious ladybird ruby, about the size of herself. She also gave us a leaf-sack to carry anything we needed. We gladly accepted this  and wearily took turns carrying the heavy sack.

## Chapter 4

Later on in our journey, we found a humungous oak with a neat hole in its centre. Amidst the bark lay golden honey, dripping and ready to be taken. Unfortunately, before we had a chance to touch it, a great swarm of bees overtook us, and we were soon being carried off to the great bee hive. There, we met Queen Bee, who fortunately was a friend of the Queen of the Dragonflies and was more than happy to donate a tasty present to our pile. This 'present' was in fact a delicious honey birthday cake, of which we were offered many more. We shared one and then carried on our way.

What a story we would have to tell when we reached the palace! I was excited yet sad, for I had still not found the perfect present for her majesty.

## Chapter 5

As we wandered back through the trees, I wondered if I would even bother going to the party. But I decided I would, for I still had plenty of other presents to give.

When we finally reached the gates of the party, I was amazed when the Queen herself came running towards me. It was then I realised that the handsome dragonfly next to me was no less than the Queen Dragonfly's long lost son.

There was much happiness in the air when we finally gave our presents to the Queen. There were many gifts &mdash; rare flowers, scented perfumes, and many types of jewellry &mdash; but none were as amazing as my contributions. When I presented her with the spider silk dress, there was much oohing and aahing. The giant ruby itself got more than its share of attention. And indeed the demolishing of the honey cake was perhaps the most glorious eating experience ever known.

But in fact the present that raised the most eyebrows was the reunion of the Queen and her son. I am extremely glad I found the perfect present.
