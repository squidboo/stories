#Friends again

###9 am
I skipped off to school my usual, jolly self, and settled down in my seat, ready for the school day to begin. My teacher, Miss Murry, entered the room of chattering children leading a slightly stressed boy behind her. The class fell silent. "Who's he?" Morgan yelled from the back of the class.

However Miss Murry turned to her pupils, ignoring Morgan's shout. "This, class, is Gaz, a new boy from Spain."

_I am running, running along the beach of Playa de las Catedrales with a boy of my age. We are laughing, giggling, failing at staying upright in the slippery sand so close to the sea. Someone is shouting, "Maria, Gaz!"_

###9:15 am
"Maria! What are you doing?" I suddenly found myself staring into Miss Murry's face, while all around me my classmates chortled with laughter. "You seemed lost in a world of your own!" The teacher exclaimed, "does Gaz **bore** you?" 

I blushed, as I felt my face turning as red as a tomato. "No, not at all Miss, I just remembered something I had forgotten!" Miss Murry contemplated what I had said, before answering that I ought to get to know Gaz a bit better, and suggested we sat together. "Only for the time being, of course."

###3:30 pm
After spending the remainder of the day sitting next to Gaz, a boy I was too shy to speak to but wanted to know more about, I was exhausted. I flopped onto my cerulean mattress, and buried my face in the teal coloured dolphin pillow my father had ordered from our home country, Spain. I finally shifted onto my back and closed my eyes.

_An expanse of amber stretches in front of me, disturbed only by the cobalt waves, tipped with ivory froth. Oh, how much I enjoy sharing these moments with Gaz, my one true friend. We lie, curled up in the sun, relaxing._

###5:12 am
I woke in the dark, and immediately reached for my bedside beryl turtle light. What was I going to say? What was I going to tell him? I reached for my notepad and started writing.

###8am
"Mum, Dad, remember when we used to live in Spain, and I used to have a great friend, can you remember what he was called?" I asked patiently. 

"It was _George_, wasn't it, no, _Garry_?" Replied my dad, straining to remember, "It started with _g_, right?"

"It was _Gaz_, wasn't it darling?" my mother queried, "That was your friend's name?"
I thanked my parents for their help, and set off to school, a spring in my step.

###8:45am
Fifteen minutes before Miss Murry took the register, I managed to question Gaz about his past life in Spain. I asked if any of his friends had come to England before him and he told me that a girl named Maria had, many years ago. 

"Would you recognise Maria if you saw her now, after so many years?" I queried. 

Gaz shifted in his seat slightly, getting comfortable before answering my question, "I am afraid that I would not, as it has been so long." 

"Indeed you are right, Gaz, my old friend, for she has been in front of you the whole time."
