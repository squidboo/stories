##Maria and Gaz

Maria skipped of to school her usal, jolly self, and settled down in her seat, ready for the school day to begin. Her teacher, Miss Murry, entered the room of chattering children leading a slightly stressed boy behind her. The class fell silent. "Who's he?" Morgan yelled from the back of the class. However Miss Murry turned to her pupils, ignoring Morgan's shout. "This, class, is Gaz, a new boy from Spain."

_She is running, running along the beach of Playa de las Catedrales with a boy of the same age. They are laughing, giggling, failing at staying upright in the slippery sand so close to the sea. Someone is shouting, "Maria, Gaz!"_

"Maria! What are you doing?" Maria suddenly found herself staring into Miss Murrys face, while all around her her classmates chortled with laughter. "You seemed lost in a world of your own!" The techer exclaimed, "does Gaz bore you?" Maria blushed, her face as red as a tomato. "No, not at all Miss, I just remembered something I had forgotten!" Miss Murry contemplated what she had said, before answering that she ought to get to know Gaz a bit better, and suggested they sat together. "Only for the time being, of course."

After spending the remainder of the day sitting next to Gaz, a boy she was to shy to speek to but wanted to know more about, Maria was exhausted. She flopped onto her cerulean mattress, and buried her face in the teal coloured dolphin pillow her father had ordered from her home country, Spain. She then shifted onto her back and closed her eyes.

_A stretch of amber stretched infront of Maria, disturbed only by the cobalt waves, tipped with ivory froth. Oh, how much she enjoyed sharing these moments with Gaz, her one true friend. They lay, curled up in the sun, relaxing._
